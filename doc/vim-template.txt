SETUP                                           *vim-skeleton-setup*

Vim-skeleton provides a way of using UltiSnips
(https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) to create dynamic file skeletons for new
files. These use 'template' or 'skeleton' snippets which all begin by an
underscore (_). Here's a simple example for a shell file:
>
    snippet _skel "Shebang" b
    #!/bin/sh
    $0
    endsnippet

After saving that new snippet, whenever an empty `sh` buffer is opened, vim will populate it with our skeleton.

The 'skel' skeleton is the least significant and will only be expanded if no
other skeletons were found. The second way of specifying a skeleton is using
Tim Pope's Projectionist plugin (https://github.com/tpope/vim-projectionist).
You should definitely read the documentation of projectionist, but it
basically enables you to add meta data about a project. It triggers vim to
read the file '.projections.json', typically located at the project root.
Vim-skeleton allows for the 'skeleton' key as:

>
    {
        "tests/test_*.py": {
            "skeleton": "unittest"
        }
    }
<
That will trigger the 'unittest' skeleton, or the '_unittest' snippet, to
expand on entering a new buffer matching the globbing.

If the skeleton should be the same for all projects,
you can use g:projectionist_heuristics in your vimrc to define a global setting:

>
    let g:projectionist_heuristics = {
          \   '*': {
          \     'tests/test_*.py': {
          \       'skeleton': 'unittest'
          \     },
          \   },
          \ }
<
And for completeness, here is an example of how the 'unittest' skeleton could
look like:

>
    snippet _unittest "Unittest skeleton" b
    import unittest
    import `!p snip.rv = fn[5:-3]`

    class Test`!p snip.rv = fn[5:-3].title()`(unittest.TestCase):
        @classmethod
        def setUpClass(cls):
            ${1:pass}

        def test_${2:function}(self):
            ${3:pass}

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()
    endsnippet
<

Note that vim-skeleton will work just fine without Projectionist installed, it
will simply ignore those skeletons.
